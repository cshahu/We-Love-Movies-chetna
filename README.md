## Project Overview

Created database and back-end application for an API which returns information about movies, theaters, reviews and critics.
Built using:

- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Knex.js

In this project, I did the following:

- Installed and used common middleware packages.
- Built application that receives requests through routes and accesses relevant information through route and query parameters.
- Ran tests from the command line.
- Created an error handler for the case where a route does not exist.
- Built an API following RESTful design principles.
- Created and customize a knexfile.js file.
- Created a connection to the database with knex.
- Wrote database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server.
- Returned joined and nested data with Knex.
- Wrote database migrations using Knex's migration tools.
- Deployed back end server to a cloud service.
